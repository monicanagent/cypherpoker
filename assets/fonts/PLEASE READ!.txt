FOR ANY USAGE
Either: Donate money to Andrew McCluskey via PayPal: nal@nalgames.com. I recommend the donation sum is what you feel the font is worth to you and what you feel is right for what you're getting from the font - I make less from doing this than you might think!

FOR PERSONAL OR NON-PROFIT USAGE
Either: Do any of the options from "For Any Usage"
Or: Drop me a line on nal@nalgames.com telling me you're using it. If possible, include what for, and if you're feeling generous, I'd love to see a sample of my font in action!
